<h1 id="content">Images</h1>
<p>Documentation and examples for opting images into responsive behavior (so they never become larger than their parent elements) and add lightweight styles to themâ€”all via classes.</p>

<h2>Responsive images</h2>
<p>Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with <code>.img-fluid</code>. This applies <code>max-width: 100%;</code> and <code>height: auto;</code> to the image so that it scales with the parent element.</p>
